# apache-filehost

A PHP-based filehost running under an apache2 webserver

This filehost is designed to be invite-only and so uses access keys and includes detailed logging


## setup
to setup filesystem, run init.sh

to add keys, run generate_key.py (AFTER setting up filesystem) - make sure to edit this script if not using /var/www/html
